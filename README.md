# Todo List - webOS Enyo

This is a simple todo list app I wrote for the Enyo framework.  I started with the HP tutorial, then wandered off when I got distracted.

It uses the excellent [database-webos](https://github.com/onecrayon/database-webos) from onecrayon ([TapNote ROCKS](http://onecrayon.com/tapnote/)).

Aside from that, the code is MIT Licensed

## Check it out

You can watch a demo here: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oln3hfGRNo>


## Try it out

To give it a whirl, get the SDK from HP, then edit index.html so that enyo.js is pulling from the right location.  After that you can [load it up in Chrome](https://developer.palm.com/content/api/release-notes/3.0.0-643.html#documentation) and experience bliss.

To put it on your TouchPad, get into [developer mode](http://www.velvetcache.org/2011/07/20/hp-touchpad-developer-mode) and then use <tt>palm-package</tt> to create and ipk, and <tt>palm-install</tt> to install it.
